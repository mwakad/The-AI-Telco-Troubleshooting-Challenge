    "# The AI Telco Troubleshooting Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Reducing the operational cost of network faults - whether caused by hardware failures or software misconfigurations - is a critical priority for modern telecom service providers (telcos).\n",
    "\n",
    "Telelogs, the automatically generated fault and event logs produced by network equipment, offer a rich source of information. Recent research has demonstrated that these logs can be used to fine-tune specialised LLMs capable of performing root-cause analysis and assisting network engineers. However, building models that generalise across unseen faults, new data distributions, and entirely new network environments, while still running efficiently on constrained edge servers, is still a significant challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric for this challenge is Pass @ 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric measures the ability of the model to produce a correct answer in a single attempt. It is computed by evaluating each of the 4 generated responses individually and averaging the correctness over all samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models will be evaluated on their capability to troubleshoot network problems together with knowledge retention. Knowledge retention is the ability to maintain general knowledge accuracy after fine-tuning. The private dataset will include network faults whose data has a different structure than telelogs, and general knowledge questions."

Other values represent the actual downtilt angle in degrees.\\n\\nBeam Scenario and Vertical Beamwidth Relationships:\\n- When the cell's Beam Scenario is set to Default or SCENARIO_1 to SCENARIO_5, the vertical beamwidth is 6 degrees.\\n- When the cell's Beam Scenario is set to SCENARIO_6 to SCENARIO_11, the vertical beamwidth is 12 degrees.\\n- When the cell's Beam Scenario is set to SCENARIO_12 or above, the vertical beamwidth is 25 degrees.\\n\\nUser plane drive test data as follows：\\n\\nTimestamp|Longitude|Latitude|GPS Speed (km/h)|5G KPI PCell RF Serving PCI|5G KPI PCell RF Serving SS-RSRP [dBm]|5G KPI PCell RF Serving SS-SINR [dB]|5G KPI PCell Layer2 MAC DL Throughput [Mbps]|Measurement PCell Neighbor Cell Top Set(Cell Level) Top 1 PCI|Measurement PCell Neighbor Cell Top Set(Cell Level) Top 2 PCI|Measurement PCell Neighbor Cell Top Set(Cell Level) Top 3 PCI|Measurement PCell Neighbor Cell Top Set(Cell Level) Top 4 PCI|Measurement PCell Neighbor Cell Top Set(Cell Level) Top 5 PCI|Measurement PCell Neighbor Cell Top Set(Cell Level) Top 1 Filtered Tx BRSRP [dBm]|Measurement PCell Neighbor Cell Top Set(Cell Level) Top 2 Filtered Tx BRSRP [dBm]|Measurement PCell Neighbor Cell Top Set(Cell Level) Top 3 Filtered Tx BRSRP [dBm]|Measurement PCell Neighbor Cell Top Set(Cell Level) Top 4 Filtered Tx BRSRP [dBm]|Measurement PCell Neighbor Cell Top Set(Cell Level) Top 5 Filtered Tx BRSRP [dBm]|5G KPI PCell Layer1 DL RB Num (Including 0)\\n2025-05-07 14:24:22.000000|128.186911|32.584055|24|330|-86.56|22.51|964.18|591|660|-|-|-|-108.59|-114.77|-|-|-|202.7\\n2025-05-07 14:24:23.000000|128.186911|32.584055|5|330|-86.01|21.17|797.53|591|660|-|-|-|-107.89|-116.76|-|-|-|207.17\\n2025-05-07 14:24:24.000000|128.185869|32.585626|8|330|-84.77|20.68|803.45|591|660|-|-|-|-106.98|-112.41|-|-|-|197.95\\n2025-05-07 14:24:25.000000|128.186911|32.584055|10|660|-85.11|19.91|258.08|591|330|-|-|-|-105.19|-115.77|-|-|-|186.76\\n2025-05-07 14:24:26.000000|128.186911|32.584055|26|660|-87.1|22.06|330.57|591|330|-|-|-|-105.13|-115.44|-|-|-|210.03\\n2025-05-07 14:24:27.000000|128.186911|32.584055|4|660|-89.17|20.81|369.32|330|591|-|-|-|-107.06|-116.01|-|-|-|206.82\\n2025-05-07 14:24:28.000000|128.186911|32.584055|24|660|-89.4|20.93|396.12|330|591|-|-|-|-105.7|-115.88|-|-|-|209.6\\n2025-05-07 14:24:29.000000|128.186911|32.584055|36|591|-87.05|21.71|911.82|330|660|597|-|-|-104.9|-114.01|-118.61|-|-|205.73\\n2025-05-07 14:24:30.000000|128.186911|32.584055|16|591|-84.2|22.14|893.16|330|660|-|-|-|-104.21|-116.47|-|-|-|205.63\\n2025-05-07 14:24:31.000000|128.186911|32.584055|36|591|-86.77|20.48|993.16|330|660|597|-|-|-105.03|-115.41|-122.84|-|-|209.06\\n\\n\\nEngeneering parameters data as follows：\\n\\ngNodeB ID|Cell ID|Longitude|Latitude|Mechanical Azimuth|Mechanical Downtilt|Digital Tilt|Digital Azimuth|Beam Scenario|Height|PCI|TxRx Mode|Max Transmit Power|Antenna Model\\n0000293|0|128.203985|32.589187|192|9|7|0|SCENARIO_9|3.0|660|64T64R|34.9|NR AAU 2\\n0033164|5|128.186986|32.585957|170|5|9|0|DEFAULT|51.1|591|32T32R|34.9|NR AAU 3\\n0033286|14|128.179948|32.574116|60|7|13|0|SCENARIO_3|56.0|597|32T32R|34.9|NR AAU 3\\n0033164|4|128.18644|32.584389|120|14|13|10|SCENARIO_4|52.9|330|32T32R|34.9|NR AAU 3\\n\n",

    "Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) is the first critical step in transforming a raw, \"base\" language model into an \"instruct\" model that can actually follow user commands. While a base model is trained to simply predict the next word on the internet, an SFT-trained model learns to act as a helpful assistant. Implemented using the **SFTTrainer** from HuggingFace's `trl` (**_Transformer Reinforcement Learning_**) library. SFT reduces the likelihood of the model \"hallucinating\" the continuation of the prompt by keeping it focused on the answer. \n",
